# This script uses the following environment variables from the variant
#
# VARIANT - build variant name
# TOP_DIR - workspace root directory
# CROSS_COMPILE - PATH to GCC including CROSS-COMPILE prefix
# DEVTREE_BUILD_ENABLED - Flag to enable building Device Trees
# DEVTREE_PATH - sub-directory containing Device Tree source files
# TARGET_BINS_PLATS - the platforms to create binaries for
# TARGET_{plat} - array of platform parameters, indexed by
#	fdts - the fdt pattern used by the platform
# LINUX_PATH - Path to Linux tree containing DT compiler and include files
# LINUX_OUT_DIR - output directory name
# LINUX_CONFIG_DEFAULT - the default linux build output
