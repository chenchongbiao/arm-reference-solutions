# select a kernel scheduling model from EAS or big-LITTLE-MP

# uses BL_SUPPORT
# uses LINUX_PATH

# if the user provides BL_SUPPORT="", we will leave that alone
# if the user provides incorrect case for EAS or big-LITTLE-MP, this will be corrected.
# if the user either does not define BL_SUPPORT or provides anything which doesn't match
#  one of EAS or big-LITTLE-MP, then we look to see what the kernel currently provides.
# if the kernel has big-LITTLE-MP, use it. If kernel has EAS, use that. Check is in that
#  order, so if both are present we will use big-LITTLE-MP.
# if the kernel doesn't have whatever resulted from the above process, we set BL_SUPPORT=""

# this script expects LINUX_PATH to already be set to point to the kernel
